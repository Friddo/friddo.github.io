>be me
>young n smol
>playing basement
>a shadow covers the room
>the sound of a thousand generations of things with 100 feet
>turn around
>a big ass 4 inch centipede speeding around
>the march of 1000 legs, unrelenting in their nastiness
>no matter how many times they die, they always come back
>a disgusting, unrelenting horde of questionable evolution that creeps into every house it can see
>the march of the million leggers continues, uhphased by the loss of millions
>they fall to the chemicals and the boots, but they persevere and come back immune
>their goal is simple, and wholly evil
>to bring suffering and disgust to all who see it
>the stench of their deaths attacks the nostrils of anything nearby
>it does not matter how many die, they alwasy return
>insufferable beings comprised of nothing more than the shit from whence they came
